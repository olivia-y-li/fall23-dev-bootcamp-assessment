    <h1> Hi, I'm Olivia Li :) </h1>
   <h3> I'm a sophomore majoring in Computer Science, and I'm from Northern Virginia (~45 minutes from DC).
  In my free time, I like to draw, watch horror movies, and get food with friends. During high school, 
  I had the chance to volunteer for STEM 4 Scouts, which is a nonprofit that connects girl scouts to coding instructors. 
  My high school provided me the chance to learn computer science early, and I enjoyed extending this opportunity 
       to others through volunteering.</h3>
