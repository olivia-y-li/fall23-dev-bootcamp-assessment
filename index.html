    <h1> Hi, I'm Olivia Li :) </h1>
    <h3> I'm a sophomore majoring in Computer Science, and I'm from Northern Virginia. When I was in high school,
    I had the chance to volunteer for STEM 4 Scouts, which is a nonprofit that connects girl scouts to coding instructors. 
    My highschool provided me the chance to learn computer science early, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to extend
        this chance to others. </h3>
