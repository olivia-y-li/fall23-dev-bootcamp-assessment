    <h1> Hi, I'm Olivia Li :) </h1>
        
    <h3> I'm a sophomore majoring in Computer Science, and I'm from Northern Virginia. During high school,
    I had the chance to volunteer for STEM 4 Scouts, which is a nonprofit that connects girl scouts to coding instructors. 
    My high school provided me the chance to learn computer science early, and I enjoyed extending this opportunity to others
        through volunteering. In my free time, I like to draw and get food with my friends. </h3>
